# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) in the ICECD Faculty Portal application.

## User Roles

### 1. Faculty (`faculty`)
- **Access**: All features including dashboard, beneficiaries, ventures, stories, follow-ups, explore, visualize, and chat
- **Restrictions**: Can only see beneficiaries assigned to them (backend already implements this)
- **Navigation**: Full sidebar with all menu items

### 2. Students/Beneficiaries (`beneficiary`)
- **Access**: Chat functionality only
- **Restrictions**: Cannot access any other features
- **Navigation**: Minimal sidebar with only "Chat" menu item
- **Home Page**: Custom student home page explaining their limited access

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Sidebar Component (`FacultySideBar.jsx`)
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Shows different menu items based on user role
- **Title**: Shows "ICECD" for faculty, "Student Portal" for students
- **Menu Items**:
  - Faculty: Dashboard, Beneficiaries, Chat, Explore, Ventures, Follow-Ups, Stories, Visualize
  - Students: Chat only

#### 2. Route Protection (`App.jsx`)
- **ProtectedRoute Component**: Wraps routes with role-based access control
- **UnauthorizedAccess Component**: Shows when users try to access restricted routes
- **Route Structure**:
  - `/chat`: Accessible by both faculty and students
  - `/`: Home page (shows appropriate page based on role)
  - All other routes: Faculty only

#### 3. Student Home Page (`StudentHome.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Explains student access limitations
- **Features**: 
  - Welcome message for students
  - Clear explanation of chat-only access
  - Direct link to chat functionality
  - Professional design matching the application theme

#### 4. Unauthorized Access Component (`UnauthorizedAccess.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Shows when users try to access unauthorized routes
- **Features**:
  - Clear error message
  - Role-specific explanations
  - Navigation options (go to allowed page or go back)

### Backend Integration

The backend already implements role-based filtering for faculty users:
- **Beneficiaries**: Faculty only see their assigned beneficiaries
- **Ventures**: Faculty only see ventures of their assigned beneficiaries  
- **Stories**: Faculty only see stories of their assigned beneficiaries
- **Follow-ups**: Faculty only see follow-ups of their assigned beneficiaries
- **Dashboard**: Faculty only see stats for their assigned beneficiaries

## Testing

### Test Users

#### Faculty Users:
- Username: `dr_nisha`, Password: `password`
- Username: `dr_priya`, Password: `password`

#### Student Users:
- Username: `amit_patel`, Password: `password`
- Username: `sara_roomie`, Password: `password`

### Test Scenarios

1. **Faculty Login**:
   - Should see full navigation menu
   - Should be able to access all features
   - Should only see their assigned beneficiaries

2. **Student Login**:
   - Should see only "Chat" in navigation
   - Should see student home page at `/`
   - Should be redirected to chat when trying to access other routes
   - Should see unauthorized access page for restricted routes

3. **Direct URL Access**:
   - Students trying to access `/dashboard` should see unauthorized access page
   - Faculty trying to access unauthorized routes should see unauthorized access page

## Security Features

1. **Route Protection**: All routes are protected by role-based access control
2. **Automatic Redirects**: Users are automatically redirected to appropriate pages
3. **Clear Feedback**: Users see clear messages when access is denied
4. **Backend Validation**: Server-side role checking prevents unauthorized API access

## Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Role**: Add admin role with full access to all features and users
2. **Granular Permissions**: Implement more detailed permission system
3. **Audit Logging**: Track user access attempts and actions
4. **Session Management**: Implement session timeout and automatic logout
